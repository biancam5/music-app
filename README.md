## Part 1: Music App Test

In this task, your mission is to create a basic music player using React.

### Objectives:

- Display a list of songs from the provided JSON file in a side panel (see Appendix B).
- Enable playing of a selected song upon user click.
- Implement the following player:
  - Display artwork and song information (provided in JSON).
  - Play/pause functionality.
  - Progress tracking for the currently playing song.
  - Song navigation using a scroller.
  - Previous and next song navigation.

### Guidelines:

- Use the create-react-app generator to build the app.
- You're allowed to leverage additional libraries if necessary.
- TypeScript usage is permissible if you prefer.
- Develop the music player from scratch (Do not use pre-built components; we're assessing your skills!).
- Styling can be done using CSS, LESS, or SASS based on your preference.
- The application should run smoothly after executing `npm install` and `npm start`, with no external dependencies beyond Node.js and npm.

**Bonus Challenge:** Impress us with your creativity! Feel free to implement any additional features that demonstrate your skills.

## Notes:

I thoroughly enjoyed building this Music app! As an additional feature, I've implemented a heart-icon to allow users to "like" songs.

### Technologies Used:

- React.js
- CSS (for styles)
- Bootstrap icons (for icons only!)
