# Part 1: Music App Test
Your mission in this task is to create a basic music player using React. 

Objectives:
• Display a list of songs from the provided JSON file in a side panel (see Appendix B).
• Enable playing of a selected song upon user click.
• Implement the following player :
• Display artwork and song information (provided in JSON).
• Play/pause functionality.
• Progress tracking for the currently playing song.
• Song navigation using a scroller.
• Previous and next song navigation.

# Guidelines:
• Use create-react-app generator to build the app.
• You're allowed to leverage additional libraries if necessary.
• TypeScript usage is permissible if you prefer.
• Develop the music player from scratch (Do not use pre-built components; we're
assessing your skills!).
• Styling can be done using CSS, LESS, or SASS based on your preference.
• The application should run smoothly a\er execuAng npm install and npm start, with
no external dependencies beyond Node.js and npm.
Bonus Challenge: Impress us with your creativity! Feel free to implement any additional
features that demonstrate your skills.
 

# Notes :

I had a lot of fun coding this  Music app!  Also I´ve built an additional feature : 
a  heart-icon for give "likes" to songs.

I´ve used : React.js , CSS (for styles) and Boostrap icons (for  the icons only!)
